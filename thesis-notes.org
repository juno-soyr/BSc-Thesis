#+title: Thesis Notes
* Ideas
** Use encodings of turing machines to compare the complexities
- Convert Lambda to NPDA and NPDA to turing
- Convert LSC to NPDA and NPDA to turing
*** Stack handling
- Redexes as unit or variables + abstractions as units?
* Background
** History of computing
- Computational models
- Turing equivalence
- Invariance thesis
** Lambda calculus history
- pretty self explanatory
* Explanations
** Lambda calculus
- Duh
- Contexts
*** Reductions
- Idea of reductions
  - Church Rosser
  - Determinism
- Leftmost outermost reduction
- Standardization
** LSC
- Duh x2
- Shallow and substitution contexts
- LOU
** Equivalence between the two and Turing machines
